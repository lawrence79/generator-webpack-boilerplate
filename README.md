## working on this project

Clone this project and then from the root directory of the project run:

```
npm install -g yo
npm link

```

Now you should be able to see Webpack Boilerplate as a generator.
Create a new directory and run:
```
yo webpack-boilerplate

```

and follow the instructions.

this is a wip.
